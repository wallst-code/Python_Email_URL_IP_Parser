# Python_Email_URL_IP_Parser
A python program that takes in an .eml and pulls the URLs and IP addresses out and will provide a defanged list as well as a fanged list in a text file. 

Note - its pretty rough - and needs work. 

No interface. Just change the file name as in the picture. 
It assumes that your .eml is in your project folder. 
It must be a .eml file. 

Output: 
1. An output text file that has a list of URLs and IP addresses - that are still "fanged".
2. A text file that has the IPs and URLs in a defanged fashion. 
3. A file that <your_email_file_name.eml>.txt file - this is the .eml file that has been converted into a text file.
